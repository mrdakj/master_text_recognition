once upon story a cow saw some hay
near the hose pen the cow went over and
ate the day then the horse got mad
and punched the cow owner the horse was
never the same after that problem
happened the cow passed and the owner
became sad and constructed a cow
pedestal for the low the horse then
went on and ate hay by the ocean
