scorpions
maybe i maybe you
can make a change to the world
we are reading out for a soul
that is kind of lost in the dark
maybe i maybe you
can find the key to the stars
to catch the spirit of hope
to save one hopeless heart
you look up to the sky
with all those questions in mind
all you need is to hear
the voice of your heart
in a world full of pain
someone is calling your name
why dont we make it true
maybe i maybe you
maybe i maybe you
are just soldiers of love
born to carry the flame
bringing light to the dark
