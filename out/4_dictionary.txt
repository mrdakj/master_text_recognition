me as a human may very well be able to
complete the paragraph that lacks the
letter of the alphabet you refer to
though one may truthfully say that you
present to us all a hard challenge to
craft a paragraph that has no appearance
of one letter not only that but kant
letter you speak of holds mass value
to the languages alphabet yet many
have done the challenge and so shall
yours truly
