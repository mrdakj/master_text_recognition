in the first chapter we described algorithm for line segmentation
later in the next chapter we introduced four models
the first model classifies english letters
the second and the third model are used to classify two combined letters
while the last model helps us to determine which model to use
in this chapter we are goiny to put everything together and to
build a program that will be able to recognize this text
