imagine there is no heaven
it is easy jf you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imogine all the people
liviny for today
imagine there is no countries
it isnt hard to do
nothing to kill or dio for
and no religion too
imagine all the people
living life in peace
yu meay say iam a dreamer
but s am not the only one
i hope someday you will join us
and the world will bc as one
imagine no possessions
i wonder if you can
no need for greed
