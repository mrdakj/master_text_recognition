imagine there is no heaven
it is easy if you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imagine all the people
living for today
imagine there is no countries
it isnt hard to do
nothing to kill or dio for
and no religion too
imagine all the people
living life in peace
yu may say iam a dreamer
but i am not the only one
i hope someday you will join us
and the world will be as one
imagine no possessions
i wonder if you can
no need for greed
